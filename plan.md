## Plan for Skate Shop Website Implementation

### Overview
The goal is to create a modern skate shop website using the existing Next.js 15+ application structure. The website will feature a homepage, product listing, product details, a shopping cart, and a checkout process. The design will be responsive and accessible, leveraging the existing UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Feature Set
1. **Homepage**: 
   - Hero section with a catchy tagline and featured products.
   - Navigation bar with links to Home, Products, About, and Contact.
   - Footer with social media links and contact information.

2. **Product Listing Page**:
   - Display a grid of skateboards with images, names, prices, and "Add to Cart" buttons.
   - Filter options for categories (e.g., skateboards, accessories).

3. **Product Details Page**:
   - Detailed view of a selected skateboard with images, description, price, and "Add to Cart" button.
   - Related products section.

4. **Shopping Cart**:
   - View selected products, quantities, and total price.
   - Option to update quantities or remove items.

5. **Checkout Page**:
   - Form for user information (name, email, address).
   - Payment integration (placeholder for now).

### Image Implementation

  ```html

  ```

### Summary
